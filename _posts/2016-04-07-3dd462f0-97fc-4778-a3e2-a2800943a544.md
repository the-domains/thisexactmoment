On a per episode basis, the drama records well over 100 millions views. For a drama that hasn't even concluded to record 2 billion views in a country with around 700 million people with access to the internet is quite an exceptional feat. With an A-list cast and a plot that covers both love and war, it's no wonder that the drama is doing so well.

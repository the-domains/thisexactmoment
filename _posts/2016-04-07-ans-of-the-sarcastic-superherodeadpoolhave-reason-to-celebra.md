Fans of the sarcastic superhero_[Deadpool][0]_have reason to celebrate as[Ryan Reynolds][1]is apparently back on board to play the title character.

_[Heroic Hollywood][2]_is reporting that Reynolds, who led_Deadpool_to a global box office of more than $750 million, will reprise the Marvel character for the already greenlit sequel. Considering the first film's massive haul, this news really isn't a surprise. It was simply just a matter of what kind of raise Reynolds would see since he only received a[reported][3]$2 million upfront salary the first time around.

Since its February 2016 release,_Deadpool_has smashed box office records and is already the highest grossing R-rated movie ever, surpassing_The Matrix Reloaded_. Unlike other recent superhero movies (cough..._BvS_...cough), it also was critically lauded, with a rating on Rotten Tomatoes of 83 percent.

There is no release date yet for Deadpool 2\.

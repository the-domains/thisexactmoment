 The couple --- who have appeared on Big Brother, The Amazing Race and Marriage Boot Camp --- were planning a wedding in Mexico for September 24, but their plans abruptly changed when Lloyd found out she was pregnant on February 22\.

"I was not expecting it!" the 29-year-old exclusively tells Us. "My mind was completely on wedding mode and not on baby mode --- was not expecting babies for like another two years, and, yeah, so then that's what happened."

"It definitely threw us through a loop, and we were kind of like, 'Well, we need to figure this out, because the baby is going to be born October 20,' and I don't want to be walking down the aisle nine months pregnant, and my dress won't fit," the

_Big Brother_

season 11 winner says. 

"I said, 'Why don't we go on ahead and go to the courthouse, and make it legal?'" she continues. "And I'm more traditional anyway, so I was like, 'I want our baby to have our same last name on the birth certificate too.' So I was like, 'Let's just go on ahead and get married, and then we'll have the baby, and then next year we'll have a wedding ceremony with all of our friends.'"

On the first available date at the courthouse --- March 15 --- the two, who got engaged on season 16 of_Big Brother_in 2014, headed to the Beverly Hills courthouse to tie the knot with a handful of friends as their witnesses.

"It actually was pretty nice," Schroeder says. "I wore my tuxedo that I wore to**[Lance Bass][0]**' wedding, so I had that in the closet to wear; Jordan wore a cute little wedding dress, and afterward, we were like movie stars. We went to the Beverly Hills Hotel and had lunch, and then, at night, we went and got massages, and then we went to Mastro's in Malibu for dinner. We lived the life that day."

They still have another big milestone to celebrate next week, when they find out the gender of the baby.

"I hope it's a girl! That's all I want, is a healthy girl," Lloyd tells_Us._"I'm around guys all the time!"

Learning the gender of their baby will give them something to celebrate, since the newlyweds had to cancel on a Dirty Pop at Sea cruise in the Caribbean that they were planning on for next week.

"We were supposed to go on this cruise with Lance Bass, and we were supposed to leave Saturday, and that was kind of a babymoon for us, but we can't go now because of the Zika virus," Schroeder explains.

"The doctor was like, 'It's not a good idea,'" Lloyd adds. "It's not worth risking the health of the baby for a week of fun."

The virus, which has been spreading around the world since the first confirmed infection in Brazil, has been linked to a birth defect of the brain called microcephaly.

In what was either an oversight or an early April Fools' joke, Netflix forgot to mention that

[its April lineup][0]

included the Warner Brothers and their Warner Sister, Dot. But thanks to

_[Daily Campus][1]_

, we now know that

_[Animaniacs][2]_

is streaming in its entirety. (To be fair, maybe Netflix was probably just really excited about getting the word out for new episodes of

_[Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt][3]._

) The animated series ran for five seasons (split between Fox Kids and The WB), racking up 99 episodes in total. '90s kids, who are

[already having][4][a great year][5]

, will undoubtedly be delighted to check in once more with

[Wakko][6]

, Yakko, the aforementioned Dot, and

[the Godpigeon][7]

, as well as Pinky and the Brain (who had

[their own spinoff][8]

).

Evidence of this can be clearly seen across the globe:<a href="http://www.iflscience.com/environment/morocco-will-have-247-solar-power-2017">Morocco</a>is nearing completion of its advanced, concentrated solar power plant, which could soon power the entire region 24 hours a day;<a href="http://www.iflscience.com/environment/sweden-combats-climate-change-aiming-be-fossil-fuel-free-nation">Sweden</a>is aiming to become the world’s first fossil fuel-free nation;<a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/costa-rica-powered-with-100-renewable-energy-for-75-days?utm_source=Article&utm_medium=Website&utm_campaign=InArticleReadMore">Costa Rica</a>, Denmark, and Hawaii are all actively focusing their energy production on renewable energy sources.</p><p>Even China, the world’s foremost greenhouse gas emitter, is contributing to this trend. Not only is it going to<a href="http://www.iflscience.com/environment/us-and-china-jointly-announce-they-will-sign-paris-climate-agreement">sign up to the Paris agreement</a>along with the U.S., but it is currently responsible for 40 percent of global renewable capacity growth – enough to power the U.K. three times over.</p><p>Switching from fossil fuels to nuclear and renewable energy sources is a smart move by<a href="http://www.iflscience.com/environment/climate-change-going-cost-us-literally">any measure</a>, and Scotland’s recent 57.7 percent renewables figure is a welcome addition to this somewhat surprising global uptick. However, Scotland’s government isn’t as scientifically conscientious as it may appear.</p><p>It recently decided to<a href="http://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/scotland-bans-gm-crops-and-all-of-science-sighs-whats-the-deal/10/08/">ban genetically modified (GM) crops</a>based on a “consumer backlash,” and presented no scientific evidence backing their decision. The scientific and agricultural world cried out in<a href="http://www.iflscience.com/environment/scotland-ban-growing-commercial-gm-crops">disbelief</a>, rightly stating that GM crops, once approved by rigorous testing, are safe for humans, animals, and the environment.</p><p>At least on climate change, the Scottish government appears to have the right idea. Saying that, it has just invested a large amount of money in research and development in the<a href="http://www.cityam.com/233548/scottish-government-unveils-funding-to-boost-north-sea-oil-and-gas-research-and-development">North Sea oil field</a>.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="45"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="46"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="47"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="48"><span data-reactid="49"><!-- react-empty: 50 --><h2 data-reactid="51"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="52">Scotland Now Generates More Than Half Of Its Electricity From Renewable Sources</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="53"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="55"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
